An IRS phone scammer decided to wake me up on a Saturday morning, so I decided to create a C# program that would
call his number non-stop, thus preventing anyone from being able to get through to this slimeball and falling
prey to his scam.

Removed some specific code from the source file that was private information tied to me directly.
